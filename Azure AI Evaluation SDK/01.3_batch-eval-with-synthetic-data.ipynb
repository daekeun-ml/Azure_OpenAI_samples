    "{\"query\":\"How do you create a run?\",\"context\":\"AML API only\",\"response\":\"To create a run using the Azure Machine Learning API, you first need to create an Experiment. Once you have an experiment, you can create a Run object that is associated with that experiment. Here is some Python code that demonstrates this process:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfrom azureml.core import Experiment, Run\\\\nfrom azureml.core.workspace import Workspace\\\\n\\\\n# Define workspace and experiment\\\\nws = Workspace.from_config()\\\\nexp = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='my_experiment')\\\\n\\\\n# Create a new run\\\\nrun = exp.start_logging()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this code, the `from_config()` method reads the configuration file that you created when you set up your Azure Machine Learning workspace. The `Experiment` constructor creates an Experiment object that is associated with your workspace, and the `start_logging()` method creates a new Run object that is associated with the Experiment. Now you can use the `run` object to log metrics, upload files, and track other information related to your machine learning experiment.\",\"ground_truth\":\"Paris is the capital of France.\"}\n",
    "{\"query\":\"How do you log a model?\",\"context\":\"Logging can be done using any OSS Sdk\",\"response\":\"There are a few ways to log models in Azure Machine Learning. \\\\n\\\\nOne way is to use the `register_model()` method of the `Run` object. The `register_model()` method logs a model file in the Azure Machine Learning service workspace and makes it available for deployment. Here's an example:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom azureml.core import Model\\\\n\\\\nmodel_path = './outputs/my_model.pkl'\\\\nmodel = Model.register(workspace=ws, model_path=model_path, model_name='my_model')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis code registers the model file located at `model_path` to the Azure Machine Learning service workspace with the name `my_model`. \\\\n\\\\nAnother way to log a model is to save it as an output of a `Run`. If your model generation code is part of a script or Jupyter notebook that runs as an Azure Machine Learning experiment, you can save the model file as an output of the `Run` object. Here's an example:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\\\\nfrom azureml.core.run import Run\\\\n\\\\n# Initialize a run object\\\\nrun = Run.get_context()\\\\n\\\\n# Train your model\\\\nX_train, y_train = ...\\\\nlog_reg = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)\\\\n\\\\n# Save the model to the Run object's outputs directory\\\\nmodel_path = 'outputs/model.pkl'\\\\njoblib.dump(value=log_reg, filename=model_path)\\\\n\\\\n# Log the model as a run artifact\\\\nrun.upload_file(name=model_path, path_or_stream=model_path)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this code, `Run.get_context()` retrieves the current run context object, which you can use to track metadata and metrics for the run. After training your model, you can use `joblib.dump()` to save the model to a file, and then log the file as an artifact of the run using `run.upload_file()`.\",\"ground_truth\":\"Paris is the capital of France.\"}\n",
