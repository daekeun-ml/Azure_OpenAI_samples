Here are some key features to consider:\n\n1. **Waterproof Ratings**: Tents are often rated in millimeters (mm) for waterproofing, which indicates how much water pressure the fabric can withstand before leaking. A rating of 1,500 mm is considered good for light rain, while 3,000 mm or higher is ideal for heavy rain.\n\n2. **Material**: Look for tents made from high-quality materials like nylon or polyester with a waterproof coating (such as silicone or polyurethane). Tents with a rainfly and a bathtub floor design are also more effective at keeping water out.\n\n3. **Seam Sealing**: Tents with taped or sealed seams provide better waterproofing, as water can seep through unsealed seams.\n\n4. **Design Features**: A well-designed tent with a rainfly that extends over the entrance, a vestibule for gear storage, and good ventilation can help keep the interior dry.\n\nSome brands known for producing highly waterproof tents include:\n\n- **Big Agnes**: Known for their high-quality materials and waterproof ratings.\n- **MSR (Mountain Safety Research)**: Offers tents with excellent waterproofing and durability.\n- **Nemo**: Their tents often feature innovative designs and high waterproof ratings.\n- **REI Co-op**: Offers a range of tents with good waterproofing at various price points.\n\nFor the most waterproof option, consider models like the MSR Hubba NX, Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL, or the Nemo Hornet.
